I am currently on vacation in Tenerife. Apart from relaxing and just getting away from the busy schedule, I am catching up on some reading in the areas of stoicism, Eckhart Tolle, and philosophies in general. 
As a result, I came to increase my practice of meditation which I want to elaborate on in this article. 


# The routine

During my vacation, it is important to get back to a regular routine of meditating. This shall happen without force but by pure choice and results of feeling great. 


# The first level - sitting and being present
This is, what I would consider, the first level of meditation. And this level can already be quite tough to master. It is about stillness and feeling. Or put simply. Being present.


The essence of this is to get out of the thinking mode and into a mode of presence. In my current level of understanding, thinking is always some sort of zoom onto something. Something that may be in the present or not. However, it is a zoom onto something. And this is what I would like to overcome in my meditation.


My goal is total presence in the now and what is. Free of any thought and free of forced focus. Let me be clear. Focus can arise, but when it does it flows freely and is not hindered by anything. As fast as it comes it can quickly seize to exist in the next moment. 


There are various ways how to help get into this state. I came to understand that there are 2 important factors in that:
- Noise of surroundings
- Warmth of surroundings

Regarding noise: For sure it is possible to be independent of any noise in your surroundings during your meditation, I find it incredibly hard to come to that level. I cannot see anything more difficult than to get to a level of presence in a surrounding with painful noise. Unfortunately, or luckily as a challenge, in a big city, there is always noise. And in my case, I find it always painful. Living in the heart of Vienna for more than 8 years taught me that you cannot escape this. 
But there is a solution. 


It is either earplugs to block out any noise. Or it is headphones that are either noise-canceling or play some white noise. I came to use the latter option currently and I enjoy it a lot. Nothing gets you easier in a mode of mindfulness when the painful noises are gone. 


Furthermore, I came to understand that noise is my number one reason for feeling unease. I realized this in my last flight, where I was blessed with the challenge of having multiple screaming kids next to me. A problem that was gone quickly with earplugs. Without the noise, everything seemed calm and friendly. I robbed those screaming babies of their power to make the flight miserable, and afterward it was a pleasureful ride. 


Regarding warmth: I realized this recently and by accident. But a very crucial factor for you being able to be present is the temperature. Even though I practiced the Wimhof method and cold exposure for quite some time, I came to understand that the cold forces you into a specific kind of meditation and presence. A form I do not want to have in my daily routine. 


For that need the most comfortable warmth I can imagine. This might vary from day to day. The solution for this is quite simple. Be careful about the warmth and adapt accordingly be your choice of place to meditate or your choice of clothes. 


# The second level - Moving meditation

I consider this the next level because it is much harder. It is in fact the level I am on currently. 
At this level, I try to not only be still but take the feeling of presence and relaxation into a moving practice. I start by simple things like doing house chores or by walking. 
I found walking to be the easier one because it allows for real wandering without any psychological pressure to accomplish anything. 


It gets more difficult when doing chores. I can observe myself often how I want to leave the state of meditation in order to "accomplish the goal" of that chore. That is a very valuable lesson. Because that is exactly the challenge for progressing in meditation. 


My answer for accomplishing this is slowness. When you observe yourself getting lost in a task and losing meditation and presence, slow down. A task that is done extremely slow will often result in presence and mindfulness. 

# The third level - Meditation and interaction

This is a level that I play around with but have not managed to master currently. It is having interactions with people in a present and mindful way. I see this as the holy grail of meditation and the doorway to endless meditation. 


The reason why this is so hard is because  most interactions form around talking about things. Talking about things requires always some sort of focus and stronger thinking. Difficult conversations force you into thinking and away from being present. 


The key here is to balance the focus on a thought with the non-focus of being present. 
This is the ultimate goal, and once mastered allows for endless peace being in the present. 

# How do you benefit?

A proper schedule of meditation helps me to stay happy and focused on my daily schedule. I monitor my body and listen to it. This allows me to use my body to the best capability. 
Most problems in today's society arise because of too much thinking and never being still and in the moment. Meditation helps. At least it does that for me. 
Please note that mastering those stages takes years. I have been practicing meditation and yoga for many years and I still consider myself on level two. Nevertheless, each level helps tremendously with life in general. 


I hope that this reflection helps to inspire you to get (more) into meditation as well.
