As with other online platforms, the verified badge shows others that your profile was somehow checked by some people of the platform to verify if your profile and content is authentic.

As I recently got into Rarible more and more and enjoy the platform I thought I give a quick look on how I did it.

## What and why

![](../assets/verfiedRarible_2021-01-06-17-07-27.png)

Some platforms rank verified profiles better than others. I don't know if this is the case for rarible. However, it helps as a sort of social proof. So if you are a creator on this platform I would suggest to go throught the very short and precise process of getting your badge.

From there [FAQ page](https://www.notion.so/rarible-com-FAQ-a47b276aa1994f7c8e3bc96d700717c5):

## How to

The way to get verified is well explained and straight forward.

In the community tab you will find a "Get verified" section.

Which will send you to a typeform page:

After that you will have to provide links to your online presence. May it be social media or other homepages. There are also some questions on how you create your art.

After you have filled out everything you will get an email after a few days if you are verified.

And that's about it. I love how uncomplicated they made the whole procedure. Well done!
