# About

In this article I quickly want to show how easy it is to create and sell a NFT art piece on opensea. You only have to pay one time a gas fee and the rest is for free. So you can circumvent the high gas fees.

[Opensea](https://opensea.io/accounts/createdd?ref=0xc36b01231a8f857b8751431c8011b09130ef92ec) has their [own article](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/7-reasons-to-sell-your-nfts-on-opensea/?ref=0xc36b01231a8f857b8751431c8011b09130ef92ec) on why they consider their platform to be one of the best to create and sell NFTs. I agree and that's why I want to show how I do it.

# 1. Get Metamask for access to Opensea

# 2. Create an account on Opensea

# 3. Create an art piece

# 4. Mint and sell your art piece

I chose to show this tutorial with [Opensea](https://opensea.io/accounts/createdd?ref=0xc36b01231a8f857b8751431c8011b09130ef92ec) because currently, it has the best workflow for getting started with NFTs in my opinion.

I do not consider myself an expert. I merely document things besides doing other things.

I am always happy for constructive input and how to improve.
