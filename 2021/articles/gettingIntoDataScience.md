# About this article

In February this year I was in Dubai working remote. Despite the pandemic and a tanking job market I was able to not only work where I like with no problems but also I am free to work on any part of a data science project without any problems and still getting a good salary. Laying on the beach I thought I gather my thoughts on this and summarize why I still love my change to data science and I think it is one of the best jobs in 2021 you can do.

I recently read that the popularity of Data Science jobs is decreasing as so many people are doing it now, flooding the market and the positions in companies get worse and worse because of this high supply. In my experience this is not true. It is ultimately about getting to know the market, knowing yourself and selling yourself accordingly. I will illustrate various aspects from my data science practice.

# Don't limit yourself to the label Data Scientist

One of the first issues I encountered multiple times is that many companies still do not know what data science is. There are various definitions and diagrams describing the role and what comes with it. Those are helpful, yet finally, it is up to you and the company to show what aspects of the whole data science department needs to be utilized in a company. Note that I will not define it here but rather show that labeling and defining your role during job application or during your work will limit your possibilities as a data scientist. Let me explain.

Right now there are so many parts of data governance in a company that it is nearly impossible for founders to know all aspects or best practices in those areas.

# Reasons why Data Science is great

## 1. It is a very diverse work

- analytics
- visualizations
- programming
- presenting
- communications
- information management
- information security
- data privacy
- architecture


## 2. You can decide for yourself on what you want to work on

## 3. You only need access to the internet

## 4. You are free to work from anywhere

## 5. Payment is high

## 6. Often you don't have to explain in detail. Results will show

Because of responsibility and difficulty of the tasks
