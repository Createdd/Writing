I am have been working as a developer for quite some time now. In nearly all positions and specializations there are discussion on what are the best tools to use. It goes with software tools like IDEs (VSCode, Webstorm, Vim, etc), or hardware tools (mac, pc, linux). It is always nice to discuss, however at the end everyone discovers his own style that fits his workflow best. As everyone does some things a little different this makes perfect sense. There is one tool that I had never discussed so far but helped me enormously at my work.

## Key aspects of productivity

First I want to state why this tool is important. The key work of what I am doing is solving problems. As a data scientist I have a big range of problems to deal with. It starts with theoretical and planning approaches, goes over implementation process and ends with a presentation or deployment.

There is never a perfect person that knows anything. This is especially true when dealing with different problems all the time. Every dataset is a little different. Has its own quirks to solve. Same goes with ML implementations. You have always your favorite ML algorithms but you often test out different approaches to make sure you get the best result metric.

So every problem needs an approach to be solved in a time efficient manner, yet produces reliable results.

The tool of choice is almost always a browser (chrome) and google. I love the memes that talk about googleing as being the only real skill of programmers.

However, the older I get, the truer I valuate it. In fact I even see it as a skill during interviews. Am not a fan of memorized algorithms. It is actually the other way around. I value the fast and best implementation and not a memorized one.

I did not want to talk about how to google things. Every gets a feeling for it in the industry after a while. (But there are also articles in that as well).

I talk about the browser and tabs.
