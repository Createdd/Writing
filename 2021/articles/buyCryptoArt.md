## Hop in

Many people right now are talking about NFTs, buying and selling them. Here is a starter on how to buy your first crypto art using metamask and binance.

You will find a detailled tutorial on their [docs](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/how-to-use-metamask)

Be aware that this is just a starter. Be careful to inform yourself more about the concepts if you plan on investing higher amounts. I will use **Metamask** and **Binance** for the tutorial steps.

### Install metamask

Install the metamask from their homepage https://metamask.io/
I simply use it as a chrome browser extension.

A detailled step-through can be found [here](https://medium.com/@mark.lasia/how-to-set-up-an-erc20-compatible-ethereum-wallet-cda8dabc4b89)



### Initialize your wallet

There will be guided steps through the setup. Create a password and a seed phrase. Store them savely and you are ready with your own wallet. There are detailled instruction provided by metamask on how to do this.

### Configure wallet for Binance

To set it up with Binance we need to configure it in the settings.

If you are having troubles here, refer to the original [docs](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain)

### Verifiying yourself

Along the process you will be asked to verify yourself with photo. Basically all payments companies will request this. Simply follow the steps, when asked.

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-14-09-08-47.png)

You can do it manually in the [settings](https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/profile?ref=62985194)

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-14-09-49-17.png)

If the webversion is buggy (it was when I tried), do it over the mobile app. Then you will receive something like this:

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-14-14-52-36.png)



## Get some Ethereum

You need a place where you can change traditional money, also called FIAT money (USD, EUR, etc) with digital money. I use  [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=62985194) here. But you can use other platforms as well (like [Bitpanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=195257848367289193)).

Be aware that there are scam sites out there, so I recommend to go with the bigger ones.


### Verify Address Ownership (Binance)

Start by verifying ownership [here](https://www.binance.com/en/my/wallet/verify-address-ownership?ref=62985194).




### Buy with credit card

Afterwards go to ["buy and sell crypto"](https://www.binance.com/en/buy-sell-crypto?ref=62985194)

It looks like this:

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-14-09-04-04.png)

Then select what you want to buy and the amount. I will start with the minimum of 15EUR and a Visa card. For bank transfers (SEPA) there is a higher amount required. So you can start with a smaller amount and credit card and see if all transactions work well, and then you can move to higher amounts.

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-14-09-11-46.png)

Make sure that you have added your credit card.


Afterwards:

### Buy with bank transfer

If you are in the EU you can use SEPA Transfer

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-16-15-17-53.png)

You will see the payment details on the right. Simply head to your online banking and send the amount to the address (Binance). Do not forget the reference number. They need this one to reference your payment. After one or two days you will have the amount transferred to your Binance account.

Then you receive a confirmation per Email

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-16-15-17-03.png)

Afterwards you will see the new amount at your "Fiat and Spot" Overview tab:

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-16-15-20-28.png)

Now you have sent money to your Binance account. The next step is to convert it to the desired crypto currency.

### Convert to ETH

First you need to buy ETH in the "buy crypto" section. As you have already send FIAT money to your Binance Account you can choose "Cash balance":

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-17-14-57-21.png)

After confirming you get:

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-17-15-00-06.png)

Going to your SPOT Wallet you can now see that you have successfully converted EUR into ETH:

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-17-15-01-08.png)

Now if you only want to have some ETH and make money by its increasing value you are already done and benefit from the rising. But if you want to have a little more risky investments you can buy some art. To do this read the following.

## Send to Metamask Wallet

Next you need to copy your Metamask wallet address:

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-17-14-51-56.png)

The go to "withdraw" Crypto, fill in the address, transfer network and amount:

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-17-14-52-55.png)

If you want to be careful you can send at first only a small amount to check if everything goes correctly. Be aware that you have to pay a fee for each transaction!

After your email and SMS validation you get:

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-17-15-09-16.png)

The processing can take some time. You will recevie some email after successful withdraw:

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-17-15-29-06.png)

and you can see it in your metamask as well:

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-17-15-30-29.png)



### Check wallet on Etherscan


You can check your wallet on Etherscan as well. Just add your wallet address instead of mine: https://etherscan.io/address/0xc36b01231a8f857b8751431c8011b09130ef92ec

You can see the new amount and the corresponding transaction. Congrats! You just send ETH to your Metamask wallet.

## Buy some crypto art

I will buy something on Nifty Gateway


- First create an account
- Validate your account (phone authentication)

https://niftygateway.com/deposit

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-17-16-19-00.png)![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-17-16-19-04.png)

And after a while you have the new balance:

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-17-16-21-14.png)

Afterwards select an art piece you like and confirm:

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-17-16-22-14.png)

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-17-16-22-38.png)

And you will see it on your nifty profile



![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-17-16-23-15.png)


Then you can withdraw your nifty to your metamask wallet:

![](../assets/buyCryptoArt_2021-02-17-16-59-15.png)

and after a while it will be open on [Opensea](https://opensea.io?ref=0xc36b01231a8f857b8751431c8011b09130ef92ec).
