## Crypto is hot

Currently the value of cryptocurrency is rising. The crypto world has its own community and for sure has its own rules on how things are sold.

Things like [selling tweets](https://www.artnome.com/news/2020/12/21/i-made-300-selling-my-tweets-as-art) or [selling a pixel for 15000 USD](https://test.steemfiles.com/nft/@stellabelle/my-latest-nft-alpha-tears-just-dropped-on-nft-showroom) are just some examples on what is possible with new technology.

I do not consider myself an expert in neither blockchain technology nor art. However I conider myself an opportunity driven entrepreneur that is why I checked it out. In the following lines I want to show how easy it is to get started in this hot industry and how you can make some money.

Of course, as in everything art related, it still depends a lot on you as artist (how you market and sell your craft) if you will be recognized and successful. However, I encourage everyone to at least try those new platforms arising from the blockchain technology.
