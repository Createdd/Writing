# Get your stats as csv file

There are 2 chrome extensions that grab your stats:

The first one is [**Medium Enhanced Stats**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/medium-enhanced-stats/jnomnfoenpdinfkpaaigokicgcfkomjo/support), which unfortunately lacks a proper date formatting when I tested it.

There is a second option is called [**Better Medium Stats**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-medium-stats/pdehepohihkkmeclfnlnipieffkomajc), which is the one I was using.

By clicking the export option you can download your stats as CSV file.

# Why is this useful?

Well, having the performance data of your old Medium articles, gives you a powerful tool for analysing what works for your target audience and what doesn't. It allows for proper A/B testing of your writing strategy.

There are already a few articles that analyse the effectiveness of writing on Medium. Yet, with this tool youcan adapt everything to your needs and makes improving easier.
