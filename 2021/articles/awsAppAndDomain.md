# All out of one box

I came to use many services from AWS. The more I use it the more I tend to like it. It is very straight-forward to set up everything and you find great official and unofficial documentation.

In my last articles, I talked about creating an own web app with python and also how to deploy it. TODO: Link articles

So now I want to show how to buy and register a domain within AWS for your web app.

One official documentation you can find [here](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/get-a-domain/).

I will illustrate how I did it with some personal points.

# Buy domain

The first thing is of course to buy a domain.
