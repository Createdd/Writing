Year 2020 comes to an end. Again, it is time to close it by reflecting on it and drawing some conclusions for ones own personal development. Upon request I share some of my findings with this community here. Feel free to comment and share your thoughts as well.

I will touch only the points which I consider worth sharing.

Trivia: I am always writing those articles on my travel. This time, during corona the travel experience is much better by having every second seat left empty during the pandemic. It is more comfortable traveling with not so crowded trains as usual.

## Covid pandemic

This of course needs to be addressed in my reflection for this year.
I already wrote an article about my views on this issue named [Another lockdown? Yes, I am enjoying it](https://medium.com/createdd-notes/another-lockdown-yes-i-am-enjoying-it-15d5651e08d4?sk=5c9d962a6560d3b51a8eb3f8efbc889f).

## Biggest takeaway

The pandemic also led to my biggest takeaway this year. It is that **humans build their identity on how they see themselves and not who they actually are**.

This is an extremely potent understanding. I consider it to be one of my greatest revelations I had in my life so far.

What do I mean with that and how do I come to this conclusion?

During the start of the crisis I finally came to read Eckhart Tolle's "Power of Now". This was the base for most of my personal development this year. I am hesitant to call it the best book I have ever read, but it is for sure one of the best in my reading history.

He elaborates on multiple concepts, one of them being the "pain body", and how people build their identity around pain. He explains how the fact being in pain or being a poor human being on this earth is in fact part of their identity. Meaning, that if you want to take the pain away of those people you are threatening their identity and ultimately their person. They treat the effort to help as an attack.

It is mindblowing to me. I was always someone to see things quite positive in this world. I thought that everyone wants to be happy and have a pain free life. I realized over the years that this is not true.

The psyche is very complex and allows humans to build their own realities. They prefer living in those realities instead of the objective reality of life. This can often be seen in the gaming industry, where people life lives of fictional dreams and prefer those world over the "real" one.

So, this understanding is very helpful to me. I do not give advise any more. I observe and ask questions. I accept that some people life in their own world and observe how they like or dislike it. I am reduced to a mere observer of people's lives. How to act in their theatric dramas.

I also came to understand that this is neither good nor bad. I stopped judging those realities. It can be quit interesting to spice up life with fictional drama. Because what is ultimately the purpose of life? Running in the system like a sheep? I don't think so. So why not build your own reality and enjoying it in this short time on earth.

## Second biggest takeaway

In addition to the previous understanding, the pandemic showed my that I can cluster the people in two basic types. First, the ones that are poor victims in this crucial bad world, and second, the ones that simply enjoy it no matter what.

It is closely related to the first understanding.For me however, there came the understanding that you will never change those types of people. It is in fact my decision if I want the victim type of people in my life. And I do. To some degree. They balance your own life. However, one should not have the close circle with those people. As at some point they will draw you into their miserable lives (from my perspective).

So, what I like to do is to focus on the people that are "successful", "happy", "humble", "grateful". People that have attributes like these. Because as I mentioned above, it IS their reality. The unsuccessful ones will remain unsuccessful. Not because the are like this, but because they build their reality around it. Often the key attribute here is the factor "openess" to new things. The less open you are, the less prone you are to successful changes in your life.

So if you thought 2020 was a "shit, bad year". Consider being more open in life. Change the majority of your related people and stay aware about yourself.

Some of those statements are provocative. See them as those. I can not elaborate on every detail, but take it as inspiration for further thoughts on the topic.

## Work and studies

This year was not so special in this reagard for me.

I found a great company to work with. I consider them very good in many aspects, making it a pleasure to work. A lot of freedom and a lot of interesting fields. I am grateful for them. And with "them" I mean the people in it. Primarily the executive board, making a proper organization possible.

Same with studies. I elaborated a lot about it in the past. Currently for me the studies serve as inspiration. It is challenging and hard. That makes it great. I learn a lot.



## Dating

Without a doubt 2020 was an intense dating year for me. I want to touch multiple issues in this regard.

### Disclaimer

I will share my experiences with women. As I am heterosexual I can only share those experiences. However, as I have a lot of male friends as well, I consider most of my findings to be applicable to the "other side" as well. So when I refer to "women" in this section, the reader can see them as "desired sexual partner". May it be male or female.

In total I used three online dating platforms, approached many women on the street (or somewhere in public), and also approached girls from my friend circle in a romantic way. Leading to multiple dating experiences in the range from the age of 18 to 40. I build my experiences only from those encounters. Meaning it is of course very biased, yet I draw some conclusions for my personal life.


### Online Dating

It started by my airbnb host suggesting me to use Tinder during my stay on Gran Canaria. There were mainly old people around so this seemed a good approach to find young people. And, in fact, it was.I was quite successful. Having many matches and multiple great meetings with woman. Some being in sexual nature and some not.

Things radically changed when being back to Vienna. Very few matches, and overall very low effort of the women. I expanded to two more platforms totallying out three dating platforms (Tinder, Bumble, OKCupid)

My findings are, that:

**Tinder** is totally overrun and the best I got out of it are one-night stands. There is no commitment from the women there. It is filled with weirdos. I do not consider it a real dating platform. For me it is a platform where you can "watch things". No real dating opportunities in my experience. You will find:
- people that look for threesomes
- men that pretend to be women
- underage girls craving male attention
- young girls craving male attention
- older woman looking for toyboys
- and
- a
- lot
- of psychically damaged people that are, and probably never will, be able to enter a "normal" love relationship ever again

In fact, it was mindlowing to me to see what happens to women/people in their lives and how they interpret it. It is a platform where very unfortunat part of society gathers to crave the one thing they cannot get: Real love.


**Bumble** is much better. Women there are much more commited. I had multiple nice dates. There are much more "real" people online. And those you meet are in fact real human beings living in Vienna and want to meet, do something for fun or have sex.

**OkCupid** is also much better than Tinder, and also better than Bumble. The unique feature is that you have a matching score with various questions you have to answer. I personally do not care about this, but women do. A lot. The result is way more commitment of them. Often they select you because of your answers and expect something specific already. Often they are willing to text and meet.

Overall I enjoyed the experience of online dating platforms, leading to the following conclusions:
- do not ONLY use them for dating. It will be frustrating
- do not waste time texting if you don't like it
- meet as fast as possible to see if the person is real
- only spent very little them with those apps. They lure you with hopes that can only fulfilled by yourself and not the app


### Findings

I very important topic was "feminism". It is a quite emotional and very misued word. I tend to not use it any more. Everybody interprets it differently. I had multiple discussions on levels of friendship, dating and during my studies.

Overall I have mainly negative associations with this term or "movement". THe reason for this is that mostly women with low intelligence use it. And they use it as an excuse or base for their aggression. It does not mean that a woman using this term is avoidable. I would say that 95% of woman actively consider themselves as a feminist. However, be careful on the amount of importance to their life. If a woman mentiones it every date you have, you can safely assume that she has a problem and not objective view on the topic. That is just my personal experience with it in real life.

I have dealt with it during my studies as well, and real feminism is a great thing. On the base of statics and with proper action. However, there was not a single time I met a women this year that could quote one proper book or study on this topic. As usual the majority follows a bandwagon of some "influencer" or "newspaper" without any critical thought. Leading to extremly stupid arguments and a completly miserable life.

Furthermore, and this is something for me as a man was very annoying, was this wave were women tend to see themselves as treasures that shall only be praised for the mere fact that they have a vagina. I am already annoyed while writing this, but it was and probably will in the future be a very present issue for all man dating.

Let me explain.

This summer there is this wave or movement of women attacking men for being approached. With "approached" I mean every act of men that are on the base of sexuality. This starts from just looking at women to actully approaching them and asking for their number. As a law graduate for me the line is the criminal law. That is quite simple. However, some women build their identify of displaying themselves in sexual manners to provoke feedback of men, just to attack them afterwards. I have seen this on all channels in various ways.

Here I do provide advice. This is the only time I actually give advice. And it is this: Block and ignore those "women". Those are not really women. Those creatures are traumatized beings craving for attention. The will annoy your life and even get you in legal troubles. So my approach and advice is: Leave them alone. Don't give them any attention. Not as man, not as woman. They will worsen your life by fictional drama. The reason I write about this issue in more emotional manner is that it actually cripples quite a lot of men. There are fortunately just very very few of those. But I was shocked to see that there are even communities building around this topic.


Apart from this, some bullet point findings. Some of them are designed to be provokingly short for reader to reflect on his own experience.

- For most woman, if they have been disappointed in 2 or more longer lasting relationships, they have tremndous issues trusting someone again.
- Regarding paying as man: Do what you want.
- Multiple women love being hunted. They enjoy the race of running and being caught.
- Multiple women love sex. But most of them are scared of being hurt. A lot.
- Good looking girls in the age of 18-27 do what they want. They have thousands or million men wanting to fuck them. If they have no interest in you then it probably stays like this.
- Woman from 27 upwards drastically change their behavior. The are often looking for a valuable partner and actually care for a man.
- This applies also to ugly women. The delure themselves into this unwritten law but by just not getting good partners. Simply because if you are ugly you will have very low success in attracting "good men".


Ultimately: Make your own experiences. Try out many things. See what works for you. As a man or a woman. Build you dating skills. Get to know yourself. What you want in a relationship and what you can provide in a relationship.

Because that's something I have seen very often. Most people really don't know what they are doing. And then they are puzzled why it doesn't work out. My approach was quite analytical but very fruitful for me.

The reason why I wrote in more detail in this article is because I know many many men and women that have real issues in this area. They are led by fear and uncertainty making their "love life" uninteresting, stale and virtually non-existant.

So try to experiment a little bit more and put in more effort :)

## Sport  and cold showers

This year was a  tremendous good year for sport. I enjoyed it a lot. I did so much that I even injured myself during the end of summer. Even though I really enjoyed every moment of being able to do so many things and enjoying a healthy body. I spend a good amount playing Beachvolleyball again which brought me great joy.

As I mentioned cold showers in every reflection of the year, here I do it again. Unfortunately My streak was broken this year. My disc prolapse of my spine forced me to stop this practice for now. Reason for this is that the cold water forces the muscles uncounsiously to tighten up. In case of my injury this leads to a downward spiral of pain and reduction of healing. So, I will slowly ease back into it as soon as the spine allows it. I have already great plans for it.

## Finally

I have many plans for the new year coming. Having already scheduled a lot, I am confident that 2021 will top 2020. The economic recesion will build a great base for economic activies and I look forward to it. I am happy that the crisis destroys all the bad business and worng behaviors in the market. Forcing out all the participants that got there without much work, and providing room for new ventures. Like a phoenix out of the ashes those shall rise.
