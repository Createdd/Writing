Year 2020 comes to an end. Again, it is time to close it by reflecting on it and drawing some conclusions for ones own personal development. Upon request I share some of my findings with this community here. Feel free to comment and share your thoughts as well.

I will touch only the points which I consider worth sharing.

Trivia: I am always writing those articles on my travel. This time, during corona the travel experience is much better by having every second seat left empty during the pandemic. It is more comfortable traveling with not so crowded trains as usual.

## Covid pandemic

This of course needs to be addressed in my reflection for this year.
I already wrote an article about my views on this issue named [Another lockdown? Yes, I am enjoying it](https://medium.com/createdd-notes/another-lockdown-yes-i-am-enjoying-it-15d5651e08d4?sk=5c9d962a6560d3b51a8eb3f8efbc889f).

## Biggest takeaway

The pandemic also led to my biggest takeaway this year. It is that **humans build their identity on how they see themselves and not who they actually are**.

This is an extremely potent understanding. I consider it to be one of my greatest revelations I had in my life so far.

What do I mean with that and how do I come to this conclusion?

During the start of the crisis I finally came to read Eckhart Tolle's "Power of Now". This was the base for most of my personal development this year. I am hesitant to call it the best book I have ever read, but it is for sure one of the best in my reading history.

He elaborates on multiple concepts, one of them being the "pain body", and how people build their identity around pain. He explains how the fact being in pain or being a poor human being on this earth is in fact part of their identity. Meaning, that if you want to take the pain away of those people you are threatening their identity and ultimately their persone. Helping them is considered as an attack.

It is mindblowing to me. I was always someone to see things quite positive in this world. I thought that everyone wants to be happy and have a pain free life. I realised over the years that this is not true.

The psyche is very complex and allows humans to build their own realities. They prefer living in those realities instead of the objective reality of life. This can often be seen in the gaming industry, where people life lives of fictional dreams and prefer those world over the "real" one.

So, this understanding is very helpful to me. I do not give advise any more. I observe and ask questions. I accept that some people life in their own world and observe how they like or dislike it. I am reduced to a mere observer of people's lifes. How to act in their theatric dramas.

I also came to understand that this is neither good nor bad. I stopped judging those realities. It can be quit interesting to spice up life with fictional drama. Because what is ultimately the purpose of life? Running in the system like a sheep? I don't think so. So why not build your own reality and enjoying it in this short time on earth.
