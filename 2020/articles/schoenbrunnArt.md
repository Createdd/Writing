The picture shows the famous Schönbrunn Palace, in Vienna, Austria.

I wonder what an AI would transform it to when supplied with various style ideas. There are many open source implementations of style transfer. I mixed and improved a bit. The idea is that AI
1. understands the objects in an image and
2. the styles of images and
3. brings both together

# Styled

Here are the results. You can guess what style inspiration was used for the AI.
