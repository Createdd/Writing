# Behind famous pictures - The esence of pictures - An AI approach

![]()

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) allow the computer to classify images. Apart from classifiying objects they also are able to give us insights on what makes a picture. What is the essence of a picture? By visualizing the layers of CNN architecturs we dive into the understanding of how machines process images. This gives provides also insights on how the human "sees" pictures.

The article shall on one side present what elements build a picture and also provide code for python implementation with Keras.

## Base Image and style image

Base image

To explain why I chose this image I quote directly Joel Tellier, Design Director of Vice (from Unplash Awards page):
> Compositionally this photo is incredible. There are layers story and history in every element. The casual nature of the subject suggests that she is completely comfortable in a place where she and her gender have never been welcome in history. Her injury and therefore struggle to attend that day, adds to the relaxed nature of her patriotic celebration alluding to a much more involved story. The numbers on the seats help to suggest the history, leaving me to wonder how many men sat where she is sitting before one (the first) woman was allowed.

For the image I chose "The Persistence of Memory" (Spanish: La persistencia de la memoria), a 1931 painting by artist Salvador Dal√≠ and one of the most recognizable works of Surrealism.

It is by far one of my favorit paintings and a great image for implementing style.




## Visualize with code

On my research to visualize feature maps of CNN layers I often came to find tutorials and implemenations that offer insight on how to approach visualization but not following through to really see and understand what the images are showing.

Multiple times you can things like those:

https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-visualize-filters-and-feature-maps-in-convolutional-neural-networks/

The approach to extract the images are great. I need them bigger for proper examination though.

so if you follow already available solutions, you can do something like this:

```py
size = 224

image = load_img(image_path).resize((size, size))
image = img_to_array(image)
image = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0)
image = preprocess_input(image)

model = vgg19.VGG19()

layer_dict = dict([(layer.name, layer) for layer in model.layers])

layer_name = 'block1_conv1'

model = Model(inputs=model.inputs, outputs=layer_dict[layer_name].output)

feature_maps = model.predict(image)

square = 8
index = 1
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(size, size))
for _ in range(square):
    for _ in range(square):


        ax = plt.subplot(square, square, index)
        ax.set_xticks([])
        ax.set_yticks([])

        plt.imshow(feature_maps[0, :, :, index-1], aspect='auto', cmap='gray')
        index += 1

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This is useful if you want to display multiple visualizations over different layers. Like

```py
for layer in layer_names:
    print(f'{"-"*100}\nLayer {layer}')
    model = Model(inputs=model.inputs, outputs=layer_dict[layer].output)

    feature_maps = model.predict(image)
    print(feature_maps.shape)

    square = 4
    index = 1
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(size, size))
    for _ in range(square):
        for _ in range(square):


            ax = plt.subplot(square, square, index)
            ax.set_xticks([])
            ax.set_yticks([])

            plt.imshow(feature_maps[0, :, :, index-1], aspect='auto', cmap='gray')
            index += 1

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
```
