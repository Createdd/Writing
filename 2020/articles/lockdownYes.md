Most countries experience another lockdown or variation of it. As many consider 2020 one of the baddest in their lives, I would like to propose otherwsise. Read why.

## Disclaimer and current situation

This was written on XXXXXXXDATEXXXXXXXXXX.

If you need more information on certain parts, feel free to point it out in the comments.

First, I want to illustrate my situation right now. This will be helpful in understanding why I chose certain solutions for my lifestyle but also why I came to those conclusions.

I currently live in Vienna, study at a university (remotely), work part-time, do various projects on the side. I am in my twenties, have a university degree, and always did a lot of sport (at least every second day). Right now, my health is not quite optimal as I was recently diagnosed with a disc prolapse (probably from doing too much sport).

This leads to the following situation:
- regarding my employment I am a 100% at home office
- I work as a data scientist, therefore I spent this time at least 99% in front of a laptop
- all my side projects are programming or online business related. Therefore I spent time in front of a laptop
- all my university assignments are either reading, programming, or online meetings. Again, in front of a computer
- Vienna currently has a variation of lockdown in place, which does not allow to leave the apartment after 8pm, moving or meeting in public is restricted, spare-time services like a gym are closed, restaurant and bars only allow to-go services
- Vienna was also recently hit by a terror attack, before the lockdown rules were in force

In this article I want to address various aspects of being in lockdown. And illustrate how I handle it from a health perspective. I do this because I was asked several times by friends and maybe it helps others as well.

I will split this into mental and physical health aspects. It is merely a way I deal with the situation. The idea of the style of writing is the motivational aspect of dealing with difficult situations. Everything that is discussed and described stems from my own experience and awareness. I have no education in the field of health or anything related. Therefore it is not intended to be advice for living a certain way.

## Lockdown as Limitation; Limitation as Clarification

A lockdown implies certain restrictions. May it be in restricting your freedom of spending your leisure time, meeting people, or just following your routine.

As human beings are creatures of habit, measurements that disrupt our habits are considered as bad. Yet, maybe it are those restrictions that may free us from bad habits? Maybe they are not bad but at least there is the opportunity to check whether a current lifestyle habit is good or bad.

In this essence, the restriction is the chance to monitor our normal behavior. The limitation shows what we are used to and what we are addicted to. Putting the behavior in the spotlight is one aspect. The other one is how we deal with it.

Limitation is very fruitful. Like a plant that cannot grow with too much water, it needs limitation as much as we human need limitation of our own excesses.

So what we can do is to use this limit as a limit test for our behavior. Examples for those limits can be:
- amount and variety of food
- number of meetings with people
- consumption of media
- number of tasks that are completed during the day
- many more

From my experience I enjoy the limitation of food for example. During normal times I am used to go out and eat at a restaurant at least once a day. May it be convenience or because I combine it with meeting people. Living in a big city I have hundreds of options on what to eat. The type of food, the quality. I indulge in this freedom and enjoy it a lot. Yet, I am happy to make this clear in times of lockdown. I consciously choose to eat very simple food. For example soup of oats. Not many spices. This is great for re-calibrating my taste and appreciating the previous freedom.

Another example from my life is the amount of consumption and the need for doing things. I am quite busy. To a degree being busy is a task in its own.
Now I deliberately take time to just be. Few minutes. Not accomplishing something. Not consuming something. Just being. This goes in the direction of meditation, but for now I don't even label it. I simply exist as part of the limitation. The limitation that shows me what has changed to the previous lifestyle and how my mind creates its own reality of what life is. Therefore the limitation is the freeing of myself and allows me to grow in my personality. I am able to see more clearly what has been to see myself in the now.

There are many more examples. It is best for you to think about yourself and see where the limitation is in fact a clarification for you.


## Experimentation as Opportunity

Another great thing of the restrictions are the possibility to explore the unknown. As the space of opportunity is narrowed down a bit (we shall be at home as much as possible) we can spark creativity within the new reality. It is a fantastic way of experimenting with new ideas. Some of those ideas might be necessary to make the isolation bearable, other ideas might be just for exploring something you didn't have the time to do before.

For me one experiment with adaption was to go for walks with people. Previously my meetings where in cafes or restaurants. Now, as (distance) walks are the only option to see people in real life, I came to the conclusion that those walks are quite beneficial for the overall system. Having a job where I sit all day demands some sort of movement in between. This is perfectly done after lunch for example. Doing my walks after lunch allow me to
- meet people in real life
- help me digest the food I ate
- get some movement and blood circulation for improved health
- get some sun (which is more and more important in the approaching winter season)
- get some fresh air
- calibrate myself for a good afternoon

As this practice has emerged through the first lockdown in spring; I continued to do it in the less restrictive times through summer just because the benefits are quite nice for me.

Again, see for yourself where you can experiment with your lifestyle choices during lockdown and you may benefit in the same way as I did so far.






## Physicial

I want to start with the physical aspects, because they seem to be easier to deal with, as many can at least acknowledge issues in this area.

As mentioned in the disclaimer, I work as a programmer and have not ideal physical health right now.
