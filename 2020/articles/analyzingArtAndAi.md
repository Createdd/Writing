# The original

This is a very interesting photo. Amazing quality and very creative building process.

The photographer seems to be quite creative in multiple endeavors. I encourage you to check out his content. Here is his website: https://www.benjaminhenon.com/about/

In my opinion it serves perfectly as a ground image for AI based neural style transfer. It is very aesthetic. Providing a great balance between clean edges and details.

Extremely satisfying to look at this.

# The styling process

In the next steps we need to find suitable inspiration for the AI to learn some styles.

I wrote about the algorithmic approach here in my article [Neural Style Transfer — A high-level approach](https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-style-transfer-a-high-level-approach-250d4414c56b).

And more about the object identification within AI in [The structure behind an award-winning photo — a deep learning approach](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-essence-behind-an-award-winning-photo-an-ai-approach-f044d908d412)

Of course there is much more to my processing of images. However this is a starter.

# Controlling styles

There is an own research paper on how styles can be controlled in an algorithm.

The paper is called ["Controlling Perceptual Factors in Neural Style Transfer"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07865.pdf), and shows various ways to detect styles from images.

As you can see there are clearly resolution cuts. Those are due to training cost of the algorithm, as the styles are transferred over pixels, which is quite calculation expensive, and therefore cost real GPU computation power. This is also the reason why you see most of the results in very low resolution and low images size.

However, one can clearly see the artistic transfer to create a new image. Styles are not merely transfered and layed over the original image. The new image is created within the algorithm.

# The art perspective

This novel approach allows to merge art with technology.

Expression with declaration.

Knowing about the output, without fully understanding the processes on the way.

Knowing methodology without all detail steps.

This process of not knowing allows to enter a new age of art.

Knowing why but not how.

Ultimately it is up to the observer to convey meaning to the piece.

A piece, made up of the old and the new.

Clarity and chaos.

The known and the unknow.
