I recently read this blog post ["API as a product. How to sell your work when all you know is a back-end"](https://towardsdatascience.com/api-as-a-product-how-to-sell-your-work-when-all-you-know-is-a-back-end-bd78b1449119) about setting up your own API and selling it.

I was quite inspired and wanted to test if it works. In just 5 days I was able to create a product from start to end. So I thought I share issues I came across, elaborate on content that is already available, and provide a quick checklist.
