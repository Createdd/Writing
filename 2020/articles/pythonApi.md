I recently read a blog post about setting up your own API and selling it.

I was quite inspired and wanted to test if it works. In just 5 days I was able to create a product from start to end. So I thought I share issues I came across, elaborate on concepts that the article was introducing, and provide a quick checklist to build something yourself.



## Table of Contents

## Stack used

We will use

- Github (Code hosting),
- Anaconda (Dependency and environment management),
- Jupyter Notebook (code development and documenation),
- Python (programming language),
- AWS (deployment),
- RapidAPI (market to sell)

## Create project formalities

This is always an annoying step. It's always the same but necessary.

1. Create local folder `mkdir NAME`
2. Create new repository on Github with `NAME`
3. Create conda environment `conda create --name NAME`
4. Activate conda environment `conda activate PATH_TO_ENVIRONMENT`
5. Create git repo `git init`
6. Connect to Github repo. Add Readme file, commit it and
```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/Createdd/pandas_transform_format.git
git push -u origin master
```

Now we have:
- [x] local folder
- [x] github repository
- [x] anaconda virtual environment
- [x] git version control





First you need to build something that provides a solution to a problem.

## Inspiration

The article ["API as a product. How to sell your work when all you know is a back-end"](https://towardsdatascience.com/api-as-a-product-how-to-sell-your-work-when-all-you-know-is-a-back-end-bd78b1449119) by Artem provided a great idea, namely to

> - Make an API that solves a problem
> - Deploy it with a serverless architecture
> - Distribute through an API Marketplace

I encourage you to have a look at his article.
