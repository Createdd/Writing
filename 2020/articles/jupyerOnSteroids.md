Doing Data Science becomes more and more necessary for companies. In nearly all cases the data scientists start their work in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Coming from a developer background you might miss various features of your favorite IDE in Jupyter Notebook. In this article i want to share my setup and various tips for tuning your notebook for better development.

## Get Jupyter Notebook

The [installation process](https://jupyter.org/install) is straight forward. If you have already a working Python environment, you can simply download it. If you are completely new to development in python, I would suggest to use Anaconda to get started and then simply install Jupyter Notebook.

## Get themes

Firstly you might want to change the appearance of your notebook. As many developers, and I, like to program with a dark background and good code highlighting, we need to get [jupyter themes](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes).

Install it with:
`pip install jupyterthemes`

Set it up with:
`jt -t chesterish -T -N`

And here you already have a nice theme for your notebook:

There are many more options to style your notebook. See the [documentation](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes#command-line-examples) and test out other themes to find the one you like the most:

## Get Notebook extensions

There are notebook extensions, which allow you to tune your notebook in a very fast and easy way.

The [installation process](https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator#installation) is again very simple:

`pip install jupyter_nbextensions_configurator`

After that you have an own configuration tab in your notebook:

There are many options to choose from. I will just name the one I use the most.

### 1. Collapsible Headings

Allows you to collapse your headlines in the notebook. This helps enormously when presenting the notebook, but also to focus on certain areas. Especially as the notebook gets larger.
