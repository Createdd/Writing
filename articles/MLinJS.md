> This library is a compilation of the tools developed in the mljs organization.
It is mainly maintained for use in the browser.

Covered tools:

- Unsupervised learning
- Supervised learning
- Artificial neural networks (ANN)
- Regression
- Optimization
- Math
- Statistics
- Data preprocessing
- Utilities like
    - Bit array operations
    - Hash table
    - Pad array
    - Binary search
    - Number comparison functions for sorting

Actively maintained and a wide variety of features! Well done!

## Machine Learning by junku901

[![githubLogo](../assets/GithubLogo/PNG/logo.png)](https://github.com/junku901/machine_learning) [On Github](https://github.com/junku901/machine_learning)

Covered features:

- Logistic Regression
- MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- KNN (K-nearest neighbors)
- K-means clustering
- 3 Optimization Algorithms (Hill-Climbing, Simulated Annealing, Genetic - Algorithm)
- Decision Tree
- NMF (non-negative matrix factorization)

It also offers an incredible browser demo here: http://joonku.com/project/machine_learning

Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be maintained :( 

However, great job!
