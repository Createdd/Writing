I will build a small application for simply rating questions. This is designed as an exercise project for React and Redux, since I am still not understanding it.

## Motivation for this article

Another small application to understand Redux and React. It feels like it's the 100th app trying to grasp Redux. But 1 month without Redux and you start at basically nothing again. I am like: "Yeah I have heard about that" - and that's it. Action, Action Creators, Reducers, Dispatch, blabla. Too many things to understand :D So once again ↗️

## Modularizing the base

Structure the components in order to fit perfectly into a Redux application.


[➡️ Codebase on Github ⬅️](https://github.com/DDCreationStudios/questionScores/tree/ad0543f1d6607048482ecec409041a3b3329e80d)

- the stopwatch component has it's own local state is not dependent on other components
- the stats and counter components are dependent on other components
- the AddQuestionForm is dependent on other components and also contains logical information
- the header and question components

Modularizing helps to
- isolate responsibilities, which means easier testing and debugging
- better scale the app and easier for the use of Redux
- better organize between teams
