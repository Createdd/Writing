Ever since I read "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman I was amazed by statistics and all cognitive biases that come along with not understanding statistics. I think it's important to remind yourself from time to time of all the cognitive fallacies that can easily turn your life to the worse. So here is a little summary - enjoy!

## Intro

Two of the most famous people talking about human misjudgment are Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett. The Vice Chairman and Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway both have talked about their efforts of overcoming cognitive fallacies in order to make decisions that yield great investments and made them some of the richest men in history. 

## Reward and Punishment Tendency

This behavior is deeply rooted into our past. Humans do more of things that they like and do less of things they don't like. This is very simply, but also very strong. It's so obvious that many people neglect it. 

## Halo Effect - Disliking/Liking Tendency

Is the tendency to like or dislike everything about a person — including things you have not observed. Humans let information based on impressions and intuitions cloud there judgment. Not only is the overall decision biased, but also finding further information is anchored to the first information and therefore will be experienced differently.

## Anchoring 

Humans are heavily rely on the first piece of information they get. Sales negotiations evolve around the first price that was made. 
Plausible information is even referenced when there is completely no reason to use it. (Tested in questions about scaling objects).

## Availability Bias

Personally my favorite one. The easier information is to retrieve the more important we qualify it. And emotional experience enhances the effect. 
People that got robbed estimate the probabilities of robberies significantly higher than non-robbed people. Smokers often denial the threat of cancer with a personal example reference of somebody, who did not get cancer and smoked a lot.

## Confirmation Bias

Another massive one. 
The tendency to search for and find confirming evidence for a belief while overlooking counter examples. 
An amazing example for that is the discussion about climate change. It is incredible hard to have intelligent conversations about the topic, because each party only looks for evidence supporting their position.

## Social Proof / Bandwagon Effect

The chances of adopting a belief increases with the amount of other people holding the belief. It is the engine of groupthink and causes unproductive meetings.

## Authority Bias
