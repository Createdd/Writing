I like to give myself the illusion that I handle many things in a "pragmatic" way. I like the concept. Therefore I dive into pragmatic concepts in programming.

This is a summary of the conclusions from ["The Pragmatic Programmer", by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas](https://www.amazon.de/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1505644110&sr=8-1&keywords=pragmatic+programmer) added with some of my thoughts.

There are already many summaries of this book. But the concepts are important and worth repeating. At the end you will find a list with other summaries, in case you want other opinions as well.

The book divides itself into the following:

1. the pragmatic philosophy
1. the pragmatic approach
1. the basic tools
1. pragmatic paranoia
1. bend or break
1. while you are coding
1. before a project
1. pragmatic projects

## Pragmatic Philosophy

Before going into it's concepts I would like to revisit it's [definition and quote Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism):

> Pragmatism considers thought an instrument or tool for prediction, problem solving and action, and rejects the idea that the function of thought is to describe, represent, or mirror reality. Pragmatists contend that most philosophical topics—such as the nature of knowledge, language, concepts, meaning, belief, and science—are all best viewed in terms of their practical uses and successes.

In the first chapter of the book general concepts and approaches are described.

- enjoy what you are doing
- find solutions instead of excuses
- fix problems where they occur and work on the source and not the result
- zoom out to the big picture and welcome changes
- set up a quality standard. Follow it.
- knowledge is power. Learn everyday as much as you can. diversify.
- communicate efficiently. Know your stuff and know your audience
