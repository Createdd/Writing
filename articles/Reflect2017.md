2017 passed by pretty quickly and so it's even more important to reflect on all the progress that I have made and what could be improved for 2018. 
Enjoy! :)

## My goals for 2017

Most of the time I have a well defined set of goals for the next year. For 2017 Some of those were: 
- Getting a job in programming
- Write 1 article a week
- Giving something back to society with a new non-profit goal
- Keep coding for at least 4 times a week
- Keep studying law at a public university
- Read at least 10 books
- Stay consistent with fitness ( at least 3 times a week)

In the following lines I will examine the progress of each goal in more detail.

## Getting a job in programming

This was huge for me. In May 2016 I quite my job in tax advisory to get into programming. Since then I was studying and learning very hard to develop the skill set to work as a developer. 

I worked through the [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum and connected with local developers as much as possible. Each day I was watching videos, reading articles, programming small algorithms or attending some programming-related meetups. 

At the end of 2016 I thought I was ready to apply for a job in this field. The great thing was that I was already connected to some programmers in the local community, which acted as a gateway into interviews. 

One important note here: I was only able to connect to local programmers because I was introducing myself as a beginner on events and offering volunteer work to THEIR projects. I did this many times and followed the projects that had a good working flow and learning experience. 

Due to all the work with local people, online presence and some sort of presentation skill I was able to get my first job as a developer pretty quickly in March. 

It was surprising to me how fast this goal could be accomplished. 

Here is a [video](https://pusher.com/sessions/meetup/freecodecamp-vienna/from-self-taught-programmer-to-job) of a talk me and [Robert](http://rob.ee/) gave during one of our non-profit events.

## Writing 1 article per week

With this goal I wanted to stay on track with all tech related news. Also I wanted to get into the habit of writing more in english (which is not my mother tongue) and build an online presence. 

I also think that writing has always been very powerful, but is even more important in this era. An article written, it can be very easy to share it across multiple platforms and get feedback from different communities. 

Writing for me is an important tool for learning things. Formulating a thought on paper with your own words is much different than simply repeatedly read information. 

However, I came to acknowledge the time investment that writing regularly demands. Quality suffers incredibly when not enough time is invested. That's one of the reasons my articles constantly lack depth. But for me this year quantity was more important than quality in terms of writing articles.
